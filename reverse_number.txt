reverse a number (approach. thinking)

Let's take example
problem:1029 
solution: 9201

This can be re-written as:

Problem:
1000*1 + 100*0 + 10*2 + 1*9 

Solution:
1*1 + 10*0 + 100*2 + 1000*9

What is the change? 
1000 in problem became 1 in solution
100 in problem became 10 in solution
10 in problem became 100 in solution
1 in problem became 1000 in solution

What is common in problem and solution 
product = 1000

What does this mean
1000/problem = solution

How will we solve this ? 
elem = problem%10
solution = 10*elem + solution
